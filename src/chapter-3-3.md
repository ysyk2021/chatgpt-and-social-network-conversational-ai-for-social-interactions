* Diversity: Users come from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and languages, making it difficult to communicate effectively.
* Misunderstandings: Differences in interpretation and understanding can lead to miscommunications and misunderstandings.
* Limited Attention Span: Users have limited attention spans and can quickly lose interest if interactions are not engaging or relevant.
* Overload of Information: Social networks can be overwhelming with a large volume of information and interactions happening simultaneously.
